[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)

Mu Torere is a game whose origins date back to the Maori tribes of New Zealand. It is a strategy game based on a low number of pawns (4 pawns per player) with 9 slots.
This program implements SARSA reinforcement algorithm to teach an AI the rules of mutorere. Once the rules have been learned, a human player can play against the AI.
